## 🧩 **README Update – Week 3**

### 🔥 Firebase Integration Setup

This project now uses **Firebase Firestore** to store and fetch program data dynamically for the **Program Listing Screen**.

#### **Steps to Set Up Firebase in Flutter**

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Create a new project (or use an existing one).
3. Click **“Add App” → “Flutter”** and follow the on-screen instructions.
4. Download the `google-services.json` file and place it inside your Flutter project:

   ```
   android/app/google-services.json
   ```
5. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     firebase_core: ^3.3.0
     cloud_firestore: ^5.4.4
   ```
6. Run the following commands to initialize Firebase:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutterfire configure
   ```
7. Initialize Firebase in your app by updating the main function:

   ```dart
   void main() async {
     WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
     await Firebase.initializeApp();
     runApp(MyApp());
   }
   ```

### 📂 **Firestore Data Structure**

Firestore Collection: `programs`

Each document inside `programs` represents a course category (e.g., `data_structures`, `java`, `python`, etc.).

**Example Document:**

```json
{
  "program_name": "Data Structures",
  "logo_url": "assets/images/program_images/datastructure.png",
  "total_courses": "5",
  "total_learners": "63k"
}
```

---

### 💻 **Fetching and Displaying Data in Flutter**

The **Program Listing Screen** uses a `StreamBuilder` to fetch data in real time from Firestore.

**Example Code:**

```dart
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class ProgramListingScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Programs')),
      body: StreamBuilder<QuerySnapshot>(
        stream: FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('programs').snapshots(),
        builder: (context, snapshot) {
          if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
            return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
          } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
            return Center(child: Text('Error loading data'));
          }

          final programs = snapshot.data!.docs;

          return ListView.builder(
            itemCount: programs.length,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              var data = programs[index].data() as Map<String, dynamic>;
              return Card(
                margin: EdgeInsets.all(8),
                child: ListTile(
                  leading: Image.asset(data['logo_url']),
                  title: Text(data['program_name']),
                  subtitle: Text(
                    '${data['total_courses']} Courses • ${data['total_learners']} Learners',
                  ),
                ),
              );
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
